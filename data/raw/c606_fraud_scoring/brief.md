# Writer brief: c606_fraud_scoring

Author profile `tribal_knowledge_staff`: Overcommitted senior engineer; dense jargon and abbreviations, assumes the reader knows the platform.
- structure=bullets_only, english=jargon_dense, hedging=none, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: anything covered by "the usual platform setup"
- length 500-1000 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 0

Service: Real-time risk scoring consuming payment events and writing decisions. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- scoring-engine (service)
- payment-events (MSK) (message_queue)
- decisions-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- scoring audit log group (log_pipeline)

Flows:
- payment-events (MSK) -> scoring-engine: payment events with customer attributes
- scoring-engine -> decisions-db (PostgreSQL): risk decisions
- scoring-engine -> scoring audit log group: audit records

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `scoring_key`
- msk `payment_events`
- rds `decisions_db` (holds pii)
- sg `decisions_sg`
- loggroup `scoring_audit`
- iam `scoring_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Export files stay in the download location until someone cleans it up.
- F2 [ambiguity, low] Mention scoring-engine naturally, but do NOT state: How callbacks to customer endpoints are signed and protected against replay. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention scoring-engine (the place where that information should have been) in the F2 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:ARC-02|...⟧ Documents uploaded by customers must be deleted within 30 days after the account is closed.
- ⟦S:VUL-01|...⟧ Vulnerabilities rated critical must be fixed in production within 7 days after they are published.
- ⟦S:TST-01|...⟧ Production data must not be copied to test or development environments.
- ⟦S:TST-02|...⟧ Test accounts in production must be removed within 7 days after the test ends.
- ⟦S:NTF-01|...⟧ Messages sent to customers must not contain card numbers, passwords or images of identity documents.
- ⟦S:EXP-02|...⟧ Exports of more than 1,000 customer records need the written approval of the data owner.
- ⟦S:FRD-01|...⟧ Transactions above 10,000 EUR must be held for review by the fraud team before they are settled.
- ⟦S:MON-01|...⟧ Alerts of severity high must be acknowledged within 15 minutes.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 500 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c606_fraud_scoring/design_marked.md
