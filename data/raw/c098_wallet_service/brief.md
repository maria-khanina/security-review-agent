# Writer brief: c098_wallet_service

Author profile `stream_of_consciousness`: Long unbroken paragraphs written as thinking aloud, flows described in the order they came to mind.
- structure=wall_of_text, english=native_sloppy, hedging=high, terminology=aliases_drift, staleness=none
- typical gaps: explicit statement of authentication method, which component stores what
- length 900-1800 words; typo rate 0.03; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 2

Service: Consumer wallet balances, top-ups and peer-to-peer transfers. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii, credentials)

Components:
- Mobile API Gateway (api_gateway)
- wallet-core (service)
- wallet-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Keycloak (identity_provider)

Flows:
- Mobile app -> Mobile API Gateway: wallet and transfer requests
- Mobile API Gateway -> Keycloak: token validation
- Mobile API Gateway -> wallet-core: authenticated requests
- wallet-core -> wallet-db (PostgreSQL): balances and transactions

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}: Retrieve wallet and balance
- POST /v1/wallets/{walletId}/topups: Top up a wallet from a funding source
- POST /v1/transfers: Transfer money between wallets
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}/transactions: List wallet transactions
- PATCH /v1/wallets/{walletId}/profile: Update wallet owner profile

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Access reviews are done only when someone leaves the company.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:AUTH-01|...⟧ Every externally reachable API endpoint must authenticate callers with OAuth2/OIDC bearer tokens or mutual TLS.
- ⟦S:AUTH-05|...⟧ Passwords must be stored only as salted hashes using argon2id or bcrypt and never in reversible form.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-01|...⟧ Every request for a customer-owned resource must verify that the caller owns or is entitled to that resource.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-04|...⟧ Administrative and debug endpoints must not be reachable from the public internet.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-03|...⟧ All external traffic must use TLS 1.2 or higher.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:DATA-01|...⟧ Services must collect and store only the personal data needed for their purpose.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:DATA-05|...⟧ Reports and exports containing personal data must require authorization, be encrypted in storage and expire.
- ⟦S:LOG-04|...⟧ Access to centralized logs must be limited to authorized staff.
- ⟦S:AUTH-02|...⟧ Internal service calls must be authenticated with mutual TLS or signed workload identity tokens.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|...⟧ Secrets must not appear in source code, configuration files, specifications or infrastructure definitions.
- ⟦S:NET-01|...⟧ Databases and message brokers must not be publicly reachable and must live in private subnets.
- ⟦S:LOG-01|...⟧ Authentication failures, privilege changes and access to sensitive data must be logged.
- ⟦S:API-01|...⟧ All external inputs must be validated against a schema and rejected if invalid.
- ⟦S:API-05|...⟧ Database queries must be parameterized; string concatenation of user input into queries is prohibited.
- ⟦S:SECRET-02|...⟧ Runtime secrets must be fetched from the approved secret store at startup.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-04|...⟧ Traffic between services and to data stores must be encrypted in transit.
- ⟦S:NET-05|...⟧ External APIs must sit behind a WAF with rate limiting.
- ⟦S:AUTH-03|...⟧ Access tokens must expire within 15 minutes and refresh tokens must be rotated on use.
- ⟦S:OPS-03|...⟧ Backups must be encrypted and restoration must be tested at least twice a year.
- ⟦S:OPS-01|...⟧ CI must scan dependencies and images and critical vulnerabilities must be fixed within 14 days.
- ⟦S:DATA-02|...⟧ Personal data must have a defined retention period and be deleted when it expires or on verified request.
- ⟦S:LOG-03|...⟧ Audit logs must be tamper-evident and retained for at least one year.
- ⟦S:LOG-02|...⟧ Logs must not contain secrets, card numbers, or personal data beyond opaque identifiers.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-06|...⟧ Encryption keys must be held in KMS, never stored with the data they protect, and rotated at least annually.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 900 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}: request fields none; response fields id, owner_name, balance, currency
- POST /v1/wallets/{walletId}/topups: request fields amount, funding_source_id; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- POST /v1/transfers: request fields from_wallet_id, to_wallet_id, amount, note; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}/transactions: request fields none; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- PATCH /v1/wallets/{walletId}/profile: request fields owner_name, phone_number, address; response fields id, owner_name, balance, currency

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c098_wallet_service/design_marked.md
