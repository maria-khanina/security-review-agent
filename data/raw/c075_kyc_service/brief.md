# Writer brief: c075_kyc_service

Author profile `methodical_architect`: Thorough and tidy, but works at a high level of abstraction and skips operational details.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: secret rotation, key ownership, who can query the database directly, logging of sensitive fields
- length 1800-2600 words; typo rate 0.0; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 2

Service: Collects identity documents, calls a third-party verification vendor, stores results. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii)

Components:
- kyc-orchestrator (service)
- kyc-documents (S3) (object_storage)
- kyc-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Identity verification vendor (third_party)

Flows:
- Customer app -> kyc-orchestrator: identity details and document images
- kyc-orchestrator -> kyc-documents (S3): document images
- kyc-orchestrator -> kyc-db (PostgreSQL): case records
- kyc-orchestrator -> Identity verification vendor: verification request

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/kyc/cases: Open a verification case
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/documents: Upload an identity document
- GET /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}: Get case status
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/submit: Submit the case to the verification vendor
- GET /v1/kyc/cases: List cases

## Planted items
- F1 [ambiguity, low] Mention kyc-orchestrator naturally, but do NOT state: Limits on request volume per client. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention kyc-orchestrator (the place where that information should have been) in the F1 marker.
- F2 [ambiguity, low] Mention kyc-documents (S3) naturally, but do NOT state: How long personal data is kept and how it is deleted. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention kyc-documents (S3) (the place where that information should have been) in the F2 marker.
- F3 [ambiguity, medium] Mention kyc-orchestrator naturally, but do NOT state: How the service checks that the caller may access the requested record. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention kyc-orchestrator (the place where that information should have been) in the F3 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:AUTH-01|...⟧ Every externally reachable API endpoint must authenticate callers with OAuth2/OIDC bearer tokens or mutual TLS.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-04|...⟧ Administrative and debug endpoints must not be reachable from the public internet.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|...⟧ Secrets must not appear in source code, configuration files, specifications or infrastructure definitions.
- ⟦S:SECRET-02|...⟧ Runtime secrets must be fetched from the approved secret store at startup.
- ⟦S:NET-02|...⟧ Object storage buckets must block public access and be private by default.
- ⟦S:LOG-01|...⟧ Authentication failures, privilege changes and access to sensitive data must be logged.
- ⟦S:LOG-02|...⟧ Logs must not contain secrets, card numbers, or personal data beyond opaque identifiers.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:API-01|...⟧ All external inputs must be validated against a schema and rejected if invalid.
- ⟦S:API-05|...⟧ Database queries must be parameterized; string concatenation of user input into queries is prohibited.
- ⟦S:API-06|...⟧ Browser-facing APIs must allow only approved origins in CORS.
- ⟦S:OPS-01|...⟧ CI must scan dependencies and images and critical vulnerabilities must be fixed within 14 days.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1800 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/kyc/cases: request fields customer_id, full_name, date_of_birth, country; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/documents: request fields document_type, content_base64; response fields document_id, received_at
- GET /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}: request fields none; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/submit: request fields consent; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- GET /v1/kyc/cases: request fields none; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c075_kyc_service/design_marked.md
