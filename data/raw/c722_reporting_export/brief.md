# Writer brief: c722_reporting_export

Author profile `ticket_writer`: Jira style with user stories, numbered requirements and acceptance criteria; non-functional requirements are afterthoughts.
- structure=ticket_style, english=native_fluent, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: security as acceptance criteria, data classification
- length 900-1700 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage light; dangling references 0; TBD markers 0

Service: Scheduled exports of settlement and transaction reports to object storage for finance. (Meridian Pay, admin exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- export-job (service)
- exports bucket (S3) (object_storage)
- reporting read replica (PostgreSQL) (database)
- reporting private subnet (network)

Flows:
- export-job -> reporting read replica (PostgreSQL): settlement and transaction queries
- export-job -> exports bucket (S3): generated report files
- Finance analysts -> exports bucket (S3): report downloads

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `export_key`
- s3 `exports_bucket` (holds pii)
- rds `reporting_ro_db` (holds pii)
- sg `reporting_sg`
- loggroup `export_audit`
- iam `export_job_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The service account of the job has a password that engineers use to log in.
- F2 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Exports of support cases contain the full numbers.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:REC-01|...⟧ Balances must be reconciled with the ledger every day, and a difference of more than 0.01 EUR must be reported to the finance team within 24 hours.
- ⟦S:REC-02|...⟧ Differences found in a reconciliation must be resolved within 5 working days.
- ⟦S:VER-01|...⟧ A replaced version of an API must be kept for 12 months, and its removal must be announced 90 days in advance.
- ⟦S:SBX-01|...⟧ The sandbox for merchants must contain no real customer data and must run separately from production.
- ⟦S:MSG-01|...⟧ Messages that cannot be processed must be moved to a dead-letter queue and be examined within one working day.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 900 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c722_reporting_export/design_marked.md
