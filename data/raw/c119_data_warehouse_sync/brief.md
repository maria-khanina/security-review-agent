# Writer brief: c119_data_warehouse_sync

Author profile `meeting_notes`: Written as decisions and open questions after a design meeting; some decisions are reversed later in the same doc.
- structure=meeting_notes, english=native_sloppy, hedging=high, terminology=aliases_drift, staleness=none
- typical gaps: final outcome of open questions
- length 700-1400 words; typo rate 0.03; markdown breakage none; dangling references 1; TBD markers 5

Service: Nightly copy of selected production tables into a staging bucket that an analytics vendor reads. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- sync-job (service)
- analytics read replica (PostgreSQL) (database)
- staging bucket (S3) (object_storage)
- Analytics vendor (third_party)

Flows:
- sync-job -> analytics read replica (PostgreSQL): table extracts
- sync-job -> staging bucket (S3): extract files
- Analytics vendor -> staging bucket (S3): extract downloads

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `warehouse_key`
- s3 `staging_bucket` (holds pii)
- rds `analytics_replica` (holds pii)
- sg `analytics_sg`
- loggroup `sync_audit`
- iam `sync_job_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Data is sent to a third party under a verbal agreement.
- F2 [ambiguity, low] Mention sync-job naturally, but do NOT state: Which personal data fields are stored and why. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention sync-job (the place where that information should have been) in the F2 marker.
- F3 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Reports are served from a publicly readable bucket to avoid generating download links.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:AUTH-02|...⟧ Internal service calls must be authenticated with mutual TLS or signed workload identity tokens.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-02|...⟧ Internal users must receive only the roles required for their job and roles must be defined per service.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-05|...⟧ Access rights to production systems must be reviewed at least quarterly.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|...⟧ Secrets must not appear in source code, configuration files, specifications or infrastructure definitions.
- ⟦S:NET-01|...⟧ Databases and message brokers must not be publicly reachable and must live in private subnets.
- ⟦S:LOG-01|...⟧ Authentication failures, privilege changes and access to sensitive data must be logged.
- ⟦S:API-05|...⟧ Database queries must be parameterized; string concatenation of user input into queries is prohibited.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 700 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c119_data_warehouse_sync/design_marked.md
