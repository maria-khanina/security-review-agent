# Writer brief: c604_data_warehouse_sync

Author profile `buzzword_pm`: Business framing, security stated as adjectives ("enterprise-grade", "secure by design") with no mechanisms.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=none, terminology=wrong_terms, staleness=none
- typical gaps: every concrete control, algorithms, token lifetimes, network boundaries
- length 900-1600 words; typo rate 0.0; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 2

Service: Nightly copy of selected production tables into a staging bucket that an analytics vendor reads. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- sync-job (service)
- analytics read replica (PostgreSQL) (database)
- staging bucket (S3) (object_storage)
- Analytics vendor (third_party)

Flows:
- sync-job -> analytics read replica (PostgreSQL): table extracts
- sync-job -> staging bucket (S3): extract files
- Analytics vendor -> staging bucket (S3): extract downloads

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `warehouse_key`
- s3 `staging_bucket` (holds pii)
- rds `analytics_replica` (holds pii)
- sg `analytics_sg`
- loggroup `sync_audit`
- iam `sync_job_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Transaction records are kept for as long as storage allows and nobody deletes them.
- F2 [ambiguity, medium] Mention sync-job naturally, but do NOT state: How fast critical vulnerabilities are fixed in production. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention sync-job (the place where that information should have been) in the F2 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:ARC-02|...⟧ Documents uploaded by customers must be deleted within 30 days after the account is closed.
- ⟦S:VUL-02|...⟧ Third-party components must not be more than two major versions behind the latest release, and the service register must show the version of each.
- ⟦S:TST-01|...⟧ Production data must not be copied to test or development environments.
- ⟦S:EXP-01|...⟧ Exported files that contain personal data must be encrypted and must be deleted from the download location after 7 days.
- ⟦S:EXP-02|...⟧ Exports of more than 1,000 customer records need the written approval of the data owner.
- ⟦S:INV-02|...⟧ The service register must list for each service the personal data that it processes and every third party that receives data from it.
- ⟦S:MON-01|...⟧ Alerts of severity high must be acknowledged within 15 minutes.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 900 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c604_data_warehouse_sync/design_marked.md
