Service: Lets merchants and support agents request, approve and track refunds of card payments. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: card_data, pii)

Components:
- Refunds Gateway (api_gateway)
- refund-core (service)
- refund-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- refund-events (Kafka) (message_queue)

Flows:
- Merchant backend and support agents -> Refunds Gateway: refund requests and approvals
- Refunds Gateway -> refund-core: authenticated refund requests
- refund-core -> refund-db (PostgreSQL): refund records with payment references
- refund-core -> refund-events (Kafka): refund status events

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/refunds: Request a refund
- GET /v1/refunds/{refundId}: Retrieve a refund
- GET /v1/refunds: List refunds
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/approval: Approve or reject a refund
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/cancellation: Cancel a pending refund

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Reports are generated for any merchant identifier that is passed to the export call.
- F2 [ambiguity, high] Mention refund-core naturally, but do NOT state: How the amount and the currency of a payment are protected from change on the way. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention refund-core (the place where that information should have been) in the F2 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:PAY-02|...⟧ Refunds and reversals above 1,000 EUR must be approved by a second person, and the person who requested the operation must not be able to approve it.
- ⟦S:PAY-01|...⟧ Every payment operation request (authorize, capture, refund or reversal) must carry an idempotency key, and a repeated key must return the original result without repeating the operation.
- ⟦S:UPL-01|...⟧ Uploaded files must not exceed 10 MB, and their type must be checked against an allowed list on the content of the file, not on its name.
- ⟦S:UPL-02|...⟧ Uploaded files must be scanned for malware before any other user or service can open them.
- ⟦S:TEN-02|...⟧ Tenant data in shared storage should be separated by row-level security or by tenant-specific encryption keys.
- ⟦S:DR-02|...⟧ The recovery time objective of a critical service must not exceed 4 hours, and it must be proven by a failover exercise at least once a year.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 500 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/refunds: request fields payment_id, amount, currency, reason, requested_by; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- GET /v1/refunds/{refundId}: request fields none; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- GET /v1/refunds: request fields none; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/approval: request fields decision, comment; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/cancellation: request fields reason; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c210_refund_service/design_marked.md
