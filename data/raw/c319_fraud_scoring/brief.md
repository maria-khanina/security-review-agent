# Writer brief: c059_fraud_scoring

Author profile `compliance_voice`: Legalistic language citing standards and "in accordance with company policy" without saying what is actually done.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=none, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: concrete mechanism behind every claimed compliance
- length 1200-2200 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 2

Service: Real-time risk scoring consuming payment events and writing decisions. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- scoring-engine (service)
- payment-events (MSK) (message_queue)
- decisions-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- scoring audit log group (log_pipeline)

Flows:
- payment-events (MSK) -> scoring-engine: payment events with customer attributes
- scoring-engine -> decisions-db (PostgreSQL): risk decisions
- scoring-engine -> scoring audit log group: audit records

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `scoring_key`
- msk `payment_events`
- rds `decisions_db` (holds pii)
- sg `decisions_sg`
- loggroup `scoring_audit`
- iam `scoring_policy`

## Planted items
None. This is a clean case: no violation and no ambiguity.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|...⟧ Secrets must not appear in source code, configuration files, specifications or infrastructure definitions.
- ⟦S:SECRET-02|...⟧ Runtime secrets must be fetched from the approved secret store at startup.
- ⟦S:LOG-01|...⟧ Authentication failures, privilege changes and access to sensitive data must be logged.
- ⟦S:LOG-02|...⟧ Logs must not contain secrets, card numbers, or personal data beyond opaque identifiers.
- ⟦S:AUTH-02|...⟧ Internal service calls must be authenticated with mutual TLS or signed workload identity tokens.
- ⟦S:DATA-02|...⟧ Personal data must have a defined retention period and be deleted when it expires or on verified request.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:API-05|...⟧ Database queries must be parameterized; string concatenation of user input into queries is prohibited.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-04|...⟧ Administrative and debug endpoints must not be reachable from the public internet.
- ⟦S:OPS-01|...⟧ CI must scan dependencies and images and critical vulnerabilities must be fixed within 14 days.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1200 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c059_fraud_scoring/design_marked.md
