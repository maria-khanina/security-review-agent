# Writer brief: c629_webhook_dispatcher

Author profile `sprint_rusher`: Terse bullet fragments, many TBD markers, sections left as headings with one line.
- structure=bullets_only, english=native_sloppy, hedging=low, terminology=aliases_drift, staleness=none
- typical gaps: auth between internal services, encryption at rest, data retention, error handling
- length 400-900 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 0

Service: Delivers signed event callbacks to merchant endpoints with retries. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: internal)

Components:
- dispatcher (service)
- delivery-queue (message_queue)
- Merchant callback endpoints (third_party)

Flows:
- Platform services -> dispatcher: events to deliver
- dispatcher -> delivery-queue: pending deliveries
- dispatcher -> Merchant callback endpoints: signed event payloads

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/subscriptions: Register a callback endpoint
- GET /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Retrieve a subscription
- POST /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/rotate-secret: Rotate the signing secret
- GET /v1/deliveries: List delivery attempts
- POST /v1/deliveries/{deliveryId}/replay: Replay a delivery

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Alerts about the service are sent to the platform team, which does not know the service.
- F2 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Deletion is requested by the customer and does not happen automatically.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:TST-01|...⟧ Production data must not be copied to test or development environments.
- ⟦S:TST-02|...⟧ Test accounts in production must be removed within 7 days after the test ends.
- ⟦S:NTF-01|...⟧ Messages sent to customers must not contain card numbers, passwords or images of identity documents.
- ⟦S:INV-02|...⟧ The service register must list for each service the personal data that it processes and every third party that receives data from it.
- ⟦S:FRD-01|...⟧ Transactions above 10,000 EUR must be held for review by the fraud team before they are settled.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 400 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/subscriptions: request fields url, event_types, description; response fields id, url, status
- GET /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: request fields none; response fields id, url, status
- POST /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/rotate-secret: request fields grace_period_hours; response fields id, url, status
- GET /v1/deliveries: request fields none; response fields id, event_type, status, attempts
- POST /v1/deliveries/{deliveryId}/replay: request fields reason; response fields id, event_type, status, attempts

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c629_webhook_dispatcher/design_marked.md
