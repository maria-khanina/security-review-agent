Service: Lets merchants and support agents request, approve and track refunds of card payments. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: card_data, pii)

Components:
- Refunds Gateway (api_gateway)
- refund-core (service)
- refund-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- refund-events (Kafka) (message_queue)

Flows:
- Merchant backend and support agents -> Refunds Gateway: refund requests and approvals
- Refunds Gateway -> refund-core: authenticated refund requests
- refund-core -> refund-db (PostgreSQL): refund records with payment references
- refund-core -> refund-events (Kafka): refund status events

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/refunds: Request a refund
- GET /v1/refunds/{refundId}: Retrieve a refund
- GET /v1/refunds: List refunds
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/approval: Approve or reject a refund
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/cancellation: Cancel a pending refund

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The code is sent to the new contact data.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Keys are remembered for one minute only.
- F3 [ambiguity, high] Mention refund-core naturally, but do NOT state: Within what time differences found in a reconciliation are resolved. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention refund-core (the place where that information should have been) in the F3 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:REC-01|...⟧ Balances must be reconciled with the ledger every day, and a difference of more than 0.01 EUR must be reported to the finance team within 24 hours.
- ⟦S:VER-01|...⟧ A replaced version of an API must be kept for 12 months, and its removal must be announced 90 days in advance.
- ⟦S:SBX-01|...⟧ The sandbox for merchants must contain no real customer data and must run separately from production.
- ⟦S:MSG-01|...⟧ Messages that cannot be processed must be moved to a dead-letter queue and be examined within one working day.
- ⟦S:MSG-02|...⟧ Messages in queues must be deleted after they are processed.
- ⟦S:JOB-01|...⟧ Scheduled jobs must run with their own service account that cannot log in interactively.
- ⟦S:SUP-01|...⟧ Support agents must see card numbers and document numbers only in masked form.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 700 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/refunds: request fields payment_id, amount, currency, reason, requested_by; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- GET /v1/refunds/{refundId}: request fields none; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- GET /v1/refunds: request fields none; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/approval: request fields decision, comment; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/cancellation: request fields reason; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c719_refund_service/design_marked.md
