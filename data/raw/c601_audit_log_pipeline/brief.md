# Writer brief: c601_audit_log_pipeline

Author profile `ticket_writer`: Jira style with user stories, numbered requirements and acceptance criteria; non-functional requirements are afterthoughts.
- structure=ticket_style, english=native_fluent, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: security as acceptance criteria, data classification
- length 900-1700 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 1; TBD markers 0

Service: Collects audit events from all services and keeps them in a tamper-evident archive. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: logs, pii)

Components:
- audit-collector (service)
- audit-stream (MSK) (message_queue)
- pipeline log group (log_pipeline)
- audit archive (S3) (object_storage)

Flows:
- Platform services -> audit-collector: audit events
- audit-collector -> audit-stream (MSK): normalized audit events
- audit-stream (MSK) -> audit archive (S3): archived audit batches
- audit-collector -> pipeline log group: collector operational logs

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `audit_key`
- msk `audit_stream`
- s3 `audit_archive` (holds logs)
- loggroup `pipeline_audit`
- backup_vault `audit_backups`
- iam `pipeline_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Test accounts are disabled but not deleted.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:ARC-01|...⟧ Transaction records must be kept for 7 years and must be deleted within 90 days after that period ends.
- ⟦S:VUL-01|...⟧ Vulnerabilities rated critical must be fixed in production within 7 days after they are published.
- ⟦S:VUL-02|...⟧ Third-party components must not be more than two major versions behind the latest release, and the service register must show the version of each.
- ⟦S:TST-01|...⟧ Production data must not be copied to test or development environments.
- ⟦S:EXP-01|...⟧ Exported files that contain personal data must be encrypted and must be deleted from the download location after 7 days.
- ⟦S:MON-01|...⟧ Alerts of severity high must be acknowledged within 15 minutes.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 900 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c601_audit_log_pipeline/design_marked.md
