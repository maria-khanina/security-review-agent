# Writer brief: c515_notification_service

Author profile `migration_delta_writer`: Describes only what changes relative to the existing system and assumes the old behavior carries over.
- structure=delta_only, english=native_fluent, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=some_outdated
- typical gaps: security properties inherited from the old system
- length 700-1500 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage light; dangling references 3; TBD markers 0

Service: Sends email, SMS and push notifications triggered by domain events. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- notifier (service)
- domain-events (Kafka) (message_queue)
- Email and SMS provider (third_party)

Flows:
- domain-events (Kafka) -> notifier: events that trigger messages
- notifier -> Email and SMS provider: recipient contact details and message body

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/notifications: Send a notification
- GET /v1/notifications/{notificationId}: Get delivery status
- PUT /v1/templates/{templateId}: Create or replace a template
- GET /v1/notifications: List notifications

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The pre-production environment differs so much from production that rollback tests are not trusted.
- F2 [ambiguity, low] Mention notifier naturally, but do NOT state: How consent to marketing messages is recorded and how a withdrawal takes effect. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention notifier (the place where that information should have been) in the F2 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:PRV-01|...⟧ Requests of customers to see or delete their personal data must be answered within 30 days and recorded in the request register.
- ⟦S:PIP-01|...⟧ Credentials of the delivery pipeline must be issued for each run and be valid for at most 1 hour.
- ⟦S:PIP-02|...⟧ Build artifacts must be signed, and the signature must be verified before deployment.
- ⟦S:OBS-01|...⟧ Traces and metrics must not contain personal data or card data.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 700 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/notifications: request fields channel, recipient_id, template_id, locale; response fields id, status, channel
- GET /v1/notifications/{notificationId}: request fields none; response fields id, status, channel
- PUT /v1/templates/{templateId}: request fields subject, body; response fields id, subject, body
- GET /v1/notifications: request fields none; response fields id, status, channel

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c515_notification_service/design_marked.md
