# Writer brief: c602_card_token_vault

Author profile `diagram_narrator`: Mostly an ASCII or mermaid diagram plus short captions; flows exist only as arrows between boxes.
- structure=diagram_narration, english=jargon_dense, hedging=none, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: trust boundaries, credentials on arrows, protocols on arrows
- length 500-1100 words; typo rate 0.0; markdown breakage none; dangling references 1; TBD markers 0

Service: PCI-scoped store that tokenizes primary account numbers for other services. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: card_data)

Components:
- tokenization-service (service)
- vault-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Vault and KMS (secret_store)
- vault private subnet (network)

Flows:
- Payment services -> tokenization-service: primary account numbers to tokenize and tokens to detokenize
- tokenization-service -> vault-db (PostgreSQL): encrypted card data
- tokenization-service -> Vault and KMS: data encryption key requests

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `vault_key`
- rds `vault_db` (holds card_data)
- sg `vault_db_sg`
- loggroup `vault_audit`
- backup_vault `vault_backups`
- iam `vault_service_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The service sends events to a partner that the register does not mention.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:ARC-01|...⟧ Transaction records must be kept for 7 years and must be deleted within 90 days after that period ends.
- ⟦S:TST-02|...⟧ Test accounts in production must be removed within 7 days after the test ends.
- ⟦S:INV-01|...⟧ Every service must have a named owner and a named deputy in the service register.
- ⟦S:FRD-01|...⟧ Transactions above 10,000 EUR must be held for review by the fraud team before they are settled.
- ⟦S:MON-01|...⟧ Alerts of severity high must be acknowledged within 15 minutes.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 500 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c602_card_token_vault/design_marked.md
