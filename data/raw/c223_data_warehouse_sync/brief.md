# Writer brief: c223_data_warehouse_sync

Author profile `copy_paste_veteran`: Built from an older design with find-and-replace; stale service names and sentences that contradict the new section.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=none, terminology=aliases_drift, staleness=heavy_copy_paste
- typical gaps: which version of the auth scheme is current
- length 1400-2400 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 1; TBD markers 2

Service: Nightly copy of selected production tables into a staging bucket that an analytics vendor reads. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- sync-job (service)
- analytics read replica (PostgreSQL) (database)
- staging bucket (S3) (object_storage)
- Analytics vendor (third_party)

Flows:
- sync-job -> analytics read replica (PostgreSQL): table extracts
- sync-job -> staging bucket (S3): extract files
- Analytics vendor -> staging bucket (S3): extract downloads

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `warehouse_key`
- s3 `staging_bucket` (holds pii)
- rds `analytics_replica` (holds pii)
- sg `analytics_sg`
- loggroup `sync_audit`
- iam `sync_job_policy`

## Planted items
None. This is a clean case: no violation and no ambiguity.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:DR-01|...⟧ Databases must have point-in-time recovery enabled with at least seven days of retention.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1400 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c223_data_warehouse_sync/design_marked.md
