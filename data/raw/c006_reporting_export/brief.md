# Writer brief: c006_reporting_export

Author profile `stream_of_consciousness`: Long unbroken paragraphs written as thinking aloud, flows described in the order they came to mind.
- structure=wall_of_text, english=native_sloppy, hedging=high, terminology=aliases_drift, staleness=none
- typical gaps: explicit statement of authentication method, which component stores what
- length 900-1800 words; typo rate 0.03; markdown breakage none; dangling references 1; TBD markers 2

Service: Scheduled exports of settlement and transaction reports to object storage for finance. (Meridian Pay, admin exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- export-job (service)
- exports bucket (S3) (object_storage)
- reporting read replica (PostgreSQL) (database)
- reporting private subnet (network)

Flows:
- export-job -> reporting read replica (PostgreSQL): settlement and transaction queries
- export-job -> exports bucket (S3): generated report files
- Finance analysts -> exports bucket (S3): report downloads

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `export_key`
- s3 `exports_bucket` (holds pii)
- rds `reporting_ro_db` (holds pii)
- sg `reporting_sg`
- loggroup `export_audit`
- iam `export_job_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The default credentials used by the service are written in its configuration and infrastructure files.
- F2 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Only HTTP access logs from the load balancer are kept.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:NET-02|...⟧ Object storage buckets must block public access and be private by default.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-04|...⟧ Administrative and debug endpoints must not be reachable from the public internet.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:DATA-02|...⟧ Personal data must have a defined retention period and be deleted when it expires or on verified request.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-04|...⟧ Traffic between services and to data stores must be encrypted in transit.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-03|...⟧ Each service must use its own database account with the minimum grants and no shared administrative credentials.
- ⟦S:AUTH-02|...⟧ Internal service calls must be authenticated with mutual TLS or signed workload identity tokens.
- ⟦S:LOG-02|...⟧ Logs must not contain secrets, card numbers, or personal data beyond opaque identifiers.
- ⟦S:API-05|...⟧ Database queries must be parameterized; string concatenation of user input into queries is prohibited.
- ⟦S:OPS-01|...⟧ CI must scan dependencies and images and critical vulnerabilities must be fixed within 14 days.
- ⟦S:OPS-02|...⟧ Containers must run as a non-root user with a read-only root filesystem where possible.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 900 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c006_reporting_export/design_marked.md
