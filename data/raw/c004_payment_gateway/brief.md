# Writer brief: c004_payment_gateway

Author profile `esl_engineer`: Competent engineer writing in a second language; missing articles, literal translations of idioms, odd word order.
- structure=clean_headings, english=esl_calques, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: negations and obligations phrased ambiguously, e.g. "should not be only encrypted"
- length 1000-1800 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 1; TBD markers 2

Service: Accepts card payments from merchants, routes to acquirers, publishes payment events. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: card_data, pii)

Components:
- Payments Edge Gateway (api_gateway)
- payments-core (service)
- payments-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Acquirer connector (third_party)
- payment-events (Kafka) (message_queue)

Flows:
- Merchant backend -> Payments Edge Gateway: payment request with card token
- Payments Edge Gateway -> payments-core: validated payment request
- payments-core -> payments-db (PostgreSQL): payment records
- payments-core -> Acquirer connector: authorization request
- payments-core -> payment-events (Kafka): payment status events

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/payments: Create a payment
- GET /v1/payments/{paymentId}: Retrieve a payment
- POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/capture: Capture an authorized payment
- POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/refunds: Refund a payment
- GET /v1/payments: List payments

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable: No scanning; versions pinned years ago.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable: Search filters built by concatenating strings into SQL.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:AUTH-01|...⟧ Every externally reachable API endpoint must authenticate callers with OAuth2/OIDC bearer tokens or mutual TLS.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-01|...⟧ Every request for a customer-owned resource must verify that the caller owns or is entitled to that resource.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-04|...⟧ Administrative and debug endpoints must not be reachable from the public internet.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-02|...⟧ Primary account numbers must never be stored in clear text and must be tokenized by the card token vault.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|...⟧ Secrets must not appear in source code, configuration files, specifications or infrastructure definitions.
- ⟦S:SECRET-02|...⟧ Runtime secrets must be fetched from the approved secret store at startup.
- ⟦S:LOG-01|...⟧ Authentication failures, privilege changes and access to sensitive data must be logged.
- ⟦S:LOG-02|...⟧ Logs must not contain secrets, card numbers, or personal data beyond opaque identifiers.
- ⟦S:DATA-02|...⟧ Personal data must have a defined retention period and be deleted when it expires or on verified request.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:API-01|...⟧ All external inputs must be validated against a schema and rejected if invalid.
- ⟦S:API-06|...⟧ Browser-facing APIs must allow only approved origins in CORS.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1000 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/payments: request fields amount, currency, card_token, merchant_id, reference; response fields id, status, amount, currency, last4, merchant_id
- GET /v1/payments/{paymentId}: request fields none; response fields id, status, amount, currency, last4, merchant_id
- POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/capture: request fields amount; response fields id, status, amount, currency, last4, merchant_id
- POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/refunds: request fields amount, reason; response fields id, status, amount
- GET /v1/payments: request fields none; response fields id, status, amount, currency, last4, merchant_id

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c004_payment_gateway/design_marked.md
