# Card Token Vault: Platform Vision and Design

Owner: Payments Platform
Status: Approved, build in progress

## 1. Vision

Every payment product we ship needs to handle cards, and every one of them should be able to do so without ever holding a card number. The Card Token Vault is the platform capability that makes this possible. Payment services hand it a card number and receive a token; when they need to charge, they hand the token back. The vault keeps the sensitive part of the world small, auditable and well guarded, so that the rest of the platform can move fast.

The vault is designed to be the foundation for the next two years of payments work: wallet top-ups from cards, recurring payments, one-click checkout and card-on-file for merchants. Each of these reuses the same two operations, tokenize and detokenize, and each of them benefits automatically from every control described below.

## 2. Architecture

The vault runs in its own private subnet, referred to as the vault private subnet. It has four parts: the tokenization-service, which exposes tokenize and detokenize; vault-db (PostgreSQL); Vault and KMS, which supply data keys and runtime secrets; and the network around them.

⟦F1|vault-db (PostgreSQL) is the main datastore of the vault and runs as a primary with a standby in a second availability zone.⟧

The infrastructure is declared in Terraform: the KMS key `vault_key`, the database `vault_db`, the security group `vault_db_sg`, the log group `vault_audit`, the backup vault `vault_backups` and the IAM policy `vault_service_policy`.

## 3. Capabilities

**Tokenize.** A payment service sends a card number and receives a token. The same card yields the same token for the same merchant, so duplicates are easy to detect downstream.

**Detokenize.** A payment service sends a token with a purpose code and receives the card number for the acquirer call. The purpose code is checked before anything is read, and every call produces an audit record.

**Key rotation.** A worker rotates data encryption keys on a schedule. Detokenization continues to work during rotation because old key versions remain available until all records have been re-wrapped.

## 4. Security controls

- ⟦S:AUTH-02|Calls from payment services to the tokenization-service are authenticated with mutual TLS or signed workload identity tokens.⟧
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-02|Staff roles are limited to what each job needs, and every service defines its own roles.⟧
- ⟦S:SECRET-02|Runtime secrets are read from the secret store when the service starts.⟧
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-05|A quarterly access review covers all production systems.⟧
- ⟦S:LOG-04|The log platform is access-controlled, and only authorized staff can read the logs.⟧
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|Cryptography is limited to the approved algorithm list, and the legacy ones (MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES, ECB) are banned.⟧
- Data at rest is encrypted with KMS-managed keys.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|No secrets are kept in source code, config files, API specs or infrastructure definitions.⟧
- ⟦S:NET-01|vault-db and the message brokers sit in private subnets and are not publicly reachable.⟧
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-01|Ownership is verified on every access to customer-owned data, not only at login.⟧
- ⟦S:API-01|All external inputs must be validated against a schema and rejected if invalid.⟧
- ⟦S:DATA-05|Each export file is encrypted at rest, readable only by the authorized requester, and removed automatically after 72 hours.⟧
- ⟦S:DATA-03|Third parties receive only the fields they need, and only if an approved data processing agreement covers them.⟧

## 5. Logging and audit

⟦F2|Access to customer records is not recorded anywhere.⟧ The audit trail covers calls to the vault only.

## 6. Build and operations

⟦F4|A raw SQL fragment from the query string is appended to the report query.⟧

The service is stateless and scales horizontally behind an internal load balancer; the database primary is the single writer. The expected peak is a few hundred tokenize calls per second at month end, with detokenize at about half that rate. Deployments are rolling, and a canary instance receives a small share of the traffic before the rest is updated.

## 7. Roadmap

The vault is built in three increments. Increment one delivers tokenize and detokenize with the controls above. Increment two adds merchant-scoped tokens so that a token from one merchant cannot be used by another. Increment three adds network tokens for the card schemes and automatic card updates. Each increment is released behind a flag and is rolled out first to internal test merchants.

The recovery objective for a regional failure is four hours and will be exercised in a quarterly game day once increment two is live.

## 8. Open items

- The final list of purpose codes for detokenize is being agreed with Compliance.
- The date of the key ceremony for the root key is not yet fixed.

# Reference material for the token service

## Token format

A token is a string of the form `tok_` followed by 24 characters from the alphabet of lower-case letters and digits. The characters are random and carry no information about the card. Two tokens never collide: the service checks the new token against the existing ones before it returns it.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| prefix | tok_ |
| length | 28 characters |
| alphabet | a to z and 0 to 9 |
| example | tok_4k2m9c0q7v1x8d3b6n5a2h0y |

The same card number always gives the same token for the same merchant. A different merchant gets a different token for the same number. This lets a merchant recognize a returning card without learning anything about the number.

## Operations in detail

**Tokenize.** The caller sends a card number, the expiry month and year, and the merchant id. The service checks the format of the number with the Luhn rule and the length for the scheme, creates or finds the token and returns it together with the last four digits and the scheme.

**Detokenize.** The caller sends a token. The service returns the card number, the expiry and the scheme.

**Lookup by last four digits.** Support tools can ask for the tokens of a merchant that end in four given digits. The answer lists tokens and expiry dates, never numbers.

### Answers

| Answer | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | the operation succeeded |
| 400 invalid_number | the number fails the Luhn rule or has the wrong length |
| 400 invalid_expiry | the expiry date is in the past or malformed |
| 404 unknown_token | the token does not exist |
| 503 unavailable | the service cannot reach its database |

## Card schemes

The scheme is derived from the first digits of the number.

| Scheme | First digits | Length |
|---|---|---|
| Visa | 4 | 13 or 16 |
| Mastercard | 51 to 55, 2221 to 2720 | 16 |
| American Express | 34, 37 | 15 |
| Maestro | 50, 56 to 69 | 12 to 19 |

The table is configuration. When a scheme adds a range, the operations team changes the configuration and the service applies it within a minute.

## Capacity

The service holds about forty million card records today and grows by about five million per year.

| Operation | Median | 95th percentile |
|---|---|---|
| tokenize | 12 ms | 28 ms |
| detokenize | 15 ms | 34 ms |
| lookup by last four digits | 20 ms | 55 ms |

The service is dimensioned for two thousand calls per second at peak. The load tests of the last quarter reached three thousand calls per second without errors; the average load is 240 calls per second, and the peak on the last Friday of the month is 900.

## Callers and volumes

| Caller | Share of calls | Main operation |
|---|---|---|
| payment gateway | 61 percent | tokenize at payment creation |
| refund service | 18 percent | detokenize for refunds to cards |
| wallet service | 14 percent | tokenize for card top-ups |
| support tools | 7 percent | lookup by last four digits |

## Migration of the old card store

The old card store of the monolith contains the same number of records. The migration copies them in batches of 50 thousand records per night. After each batch, the service compares a random sample of 1,000 records with the old store. The migration is complete when the number of records is equal and the last three samples match completely. The old store is switched to read-only on the day of the last batch, and removed one month later.

## Glossary

- **Token**: a random string that stands for a card number.
- **Scheme**: the card network.
- **Luhn rule**: the check digit rule for card numbers.
- **Merchant id**: the identifier of the merchant for whom a token is made.
- **Batch**: a group of records copied in one step of the migration.

## Questions of the integrating teams

**Can I compare two tokens of different merchants?** No, they differ for the same card.

**Does a token expire?** No. A token stays valid as long as the card record exists.

**What happens when a card is replaced by the bank?** The customer adds the new card, and it gets a new token.

**How do I get the scheme of a token?** It is returned by the tokenize call, together with the last four digits.

## Case model

A verification case follows one customer through the identity check. A customer can have several cases over time, for example after a change of name, but only one case can be open at once.

| Field | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| id | identifier of the case | case_7710 |
| customer_id | the customer the case belongs to | cus_30481 |
| status | open, submitted, approved, rejected, needs_review | submitted |
| risk_level | unknown, low, medium, high | low |
| created_at | time the case was opened, UTC | 2026-02-03T08:40:12Z |
| updated_at | time of the last change, UTC | 2026-02-03T08:47:55Z |

### Status changes

| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| open | submitted | the customer gives consent and the case is sent to the vendor |
| submitted | approved | the vendor reports a match with low or medium risk |
| submitted | rejected | the vendor reports a mismatch |
| submitted | needs_review | the vendor does not answer in five minutes, or reports an unclear result |
| needs_review | approved | an analyst accepts the case |
| needs_review | rejected | an analyst rejects the case |

A case in `approved` or `rejected` is closed. A new check needs a new case.

## What the customer enters

The customer enters the full name, the date of birth and the country of residence, and photographs one identity document. The supported documents depend on the country.

| Country group | Accepted documents |
|---|---|
| EU and EEA | passport, national identity card, driving licence |
| United Kingdom | passport, driving licence |
| Other | passport only |

For documents with two sides, such as identity cards, the customer photographs both sides, and the app uploads them as two documents of the same case. The app helps with the photograph: it shows an outline, checks the sharpness and the brightness, and asks for a new picture if the text cannot be read.

## The vendor exchange

When a case is submitted, the orchestrator sends the vendor the data of the customer and the references of the images. The vendor answers asynchronously through a callback. The callback carries the vendor request id, the result (`match`, `mismatch`, `unclear`) and a risk level suggested by the vendor.

The orchestrator maps the result to a status. A `match` with the risk level `low` or `medium` becomes `approved`; a `match` with the risk level `high` becomes `needs_review`; a `mismatch` becomes `rejected`; an `unclear` result becomes `needs_review`. The vendor sends each answer at most once, but the orchestrator ignores a second answer for the same request id.

## The review queue

Cases in `needs_review` appear in the queue of the analysts. The queue is sorted by age, oldest first. An analyst opens a case, sees the data of the customer and the images, and decides to accept or reject. The decision needs a short comment. The target is that no case waits longer than four working hours.

| Week | Cases in review (average) | Share of all cases |
|---|---|---|
| pilot week 1 | 41 | 7.8 percent |
| pilot week 2 | 36 | 6.4 percent |
| pilot week 3 | 29 | 5.1 percent |
| pilot week 4 | 27 | 4.7 percent |

The share fell because the app now rejects pictures that are too dark before the upload, which removed many unclear results.

## Capacity

The service handles about 2,400 new cases per day at the start and is dimensioned for 10,000. A case produces on average 2.3 images of about 1.4 MB each.

| Operation | Median | 95th percentile |
|---|---|---|
| open a case | 70 ms | 160 ms |
| upload an image | 380 ms | 900 ms |
| read a case | 25 ms | 60 ms |
| submit | 150 ms | 340 ms |
| list cases (page of 20) | 45 ms | 110 ms |

The vendor needs 40 seconds at the median and 3 minutes at the 95th percentile to answer.

## Localization

The app is available in eleven languages. The error messages of the service are codes, and the app translates them. The names of countries use the ISO 3166 two-letter codes; the app shows the local names. Dates of birth are sent as `YYYY-MM-DD` and shown in the format of the phone.

## Release plan

| App release | Service change |
|---|---|
| 5.0 | read endpoints and case status screen |
| 5.1 | opening cases and uploading documents, ten percent of new customers |
| 5.2 | all new customers |
| 5.3 | customers with an existing case in the old platform |

## Glossary

- **Case**: one run of the identity check for one customer.
- **Vendor**: the external company that compares the document and the data.
- **Analyst**: a member of the operations team who reviews cases.
- **Risk level**: the estimate of the vendor how likely the identity is false.
- **Needs review**: a case that a person has to decide.

## Questions of the app team

**Can the customer change the name after the case is submitted?** No. The case has to be rejected or finished first.

**How many pictures can a case have?** Up to six.

**What does the app show for `needs_review`?** A neutral message that the check takes longer than usual.

**Can the customer start a second case while one is open?** No, the service answers `case_already_open`.

# Appendix 2: related system, Ledger Service; reference material for the ledger

## Chart of accounts

Accounts are grouped into classes by the first digit of the number. The classes follow the usual double-entry layout.

| Class | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | assets | 1100 customer funds, 1200 funds at acquirers |
| 2 | liabilities | 2100 wallet balances, 2200 merchant payables |
| 3 | equity | 3100 retained result |
| 4 | income | 4100 payment fees, 4200 payout fees |
| 5 | expenses | 5100 acquirer fees, 5200 refunds written off |

Every wallet has its own account in class 2, every merchant its own account in class 2, and the platform accounts in the other classes are shared. Account numbers have the form `class-group-id`, for example `2100-0001-5521`.

## Entry model

An entry moves one amount from a debit account to a credit account. The amount is a positive whole number in minor units. Complex bookings use several entries with the same booking reference.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| id | identifier of the entry |
| debit_account | account that is debited |
| credit_account | account that is credited |
| amount | positive whole number in minor units |
| currency | ISO 4217 code |
| reference | text that links the entry to the business event |
| posted_at | time of posting, UTC |

### Posting rules

- Debit and credit accounts must differ.
- Both accounts must exist and be open.
- The currency of the entry must be the currency of both accounts.
- An entry is posted exactly once; the posting time is set by the ledger.
- Entries are never changed and never removed.

## Typical bookings

**Capture of a card payment of 100.00 EUR with a fee of 1.50 EUR.**

| Entry | Debit | Credit | Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1200 funds at acquirers | 2200 merchant payable | 10000 |
| 2 | 2200 merchant payable | 4100 payment fees | 150 |

**Wallet transfer of 15.50 EUR.**

| Entry | Debit | Credit | Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2100 wallet of the sender | 2100 wallet of the receiver | 1550 |

**Reversal of the transfer.** The reversal is a new entry with debit and credit swapped and a reference to the original entry. The original stays in the ledger.

## Balances

The balance of an account is the sum of its credits minus the sum of its debits for accounts of class 2, 3 and 4, and the opposite for classes 1 and 5. The ledger keeps a running balance with each account to avoid summing all entries on every read. The nightly check compares the running balances with the sums.

## Events

Each posted entry is published to the ledger-events topic. The event holds the entry id, the accounts, the amount, the currency, the reference and the posting time. Consumers are the reporting jobs, the notification service and the finance team's export. Events of one account are published in order.

## Capacity

| Measure | Value at start | Dimensioned for |
|---|---|---|
| entries per day | 1.1 million | 5 million |
| entries per second at peak | 60 | 300 |
| accounts | 2.4 million | 8 million |

| Operation | Median | 95th percentile |
|---|---|---|
| post an entry | 22 ms | 60 ms |
| read an entry | 8 ms | 20 ms |
| read a balance | 6 ms | 15 ms |
| list entries (page of 100) | 30 ms | 75 ms |
| reversal | 28 ms | 70 ms |

## Month-end

On the last working day of the month the finance team closes the period. The close runs these steps in order: the ledger stops accepting entries dated in the closing period, the nightly check runs, the reporting jobs produce the trial balance, and the finance team signs the result. Entries for the closed period are booked in the next period with a reference to the original date.

## Migration from the old module

| Step | Content | Check |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | copy the chart of accounts | numbers equal |
| 2 | copy opening balances | sums equal per class |
| 3 | post in parallel for one month | daily comparison of balances |
| 4 | switch readers to the new service | reports equal |
| 5 | archive the old tables | none |

## Glossary

- **Debit** and **credit**: the two sides of an entry.
- **Posting**: writing an entry to the ledger.
- **Reversal**: a new entry that cancels the effect of an earlier one.
- **Trial balance**: the list of all account balances at a date.
- **Period**: a month for which the books are closed.

## Questions of the finance team

**Can an entry be deleted?** No. A mistake is reversed and the right entry is posted.

**Why does the balance of a merchant payable change after a refund?** A refund is posted as a debit of the merchant payable and a credit of funds at acquirers.

**Which time zone has the posting time?** UTC; the reports convert to the time zone of the reader.

**Can two entries have the same reference?** Yes; a business event can need several entries.
