## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The deadline is counted from the day the team has verified the request, which can take weeks.
- F2 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The vendor stores the files in a region chosen by the vendor.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:PIP-02|...⟧ Build artifacts must be signed, and the signature must be verified before deployment.
- ⟦S:CHG-02|...⟧ Every change to production must have a rollback plan that has been tested in a pre-production environment.
- ⟦S:OBS-01|...⟧ Traces and metrics must not contain personal data or card data.
- ⟦S:PRV-03|...⟧ Personal data must be used only for purposes listed in the privacy notice shown to customers at sign-up.
- ⟦S:CHG-01|...⟧ Every change to production must be reviewed by a second engineer before it is deployed.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1200 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- GET /v1/customers: request fields none; response fields id, full_name, email, phone_number, status
- GET /v1/customers/{customerId}: request fields none; response fields id, full_name, email, phone_number, status
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/second-factor-reset: request fields reason, ticket_id; response fields id, status
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/credits: request fields amount, currency, reason, ticket_id; response fields id, amount, currency, status
- GET /v1/agent-actions: request fields none; response fields id, agent_id, action, created_at
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/data-export: request fields format, reason; response fields id, status, expires_at

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c516_support_console_api/design_marked.md
