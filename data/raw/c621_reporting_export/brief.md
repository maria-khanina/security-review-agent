Service: Scheduled exports of settlement and transaction reports to object storage for finance. (Meridian Pay, admin exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- export-job (service)
- exports bucket (S3) (object_storage)
- reporting read replica (PostgreSQL) (database)
- reporting private subnet (network)

Flows:
- export-job -> reporting read replica (PostgreSQL): settlement and transaction queries
- export-job -> exports bucket (S3): generated report files
- Finance analysts -> exports bucket (S3): report downloads

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `export_key`
- s3 `exports_bucket` (holds pii)
- rds `reporting_ro_db` (holds pii)
- sg `reporting_sg`
- loggroup `export_audit`
- iam `export_job_policy`

## Planted items
None. This is a clean case: no violation and no ambiguity.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:VUL-01|...⟧ Vulnerabilities rated critical must be fixed in production within 7 days after they are published.
- ⟦S:VUL-02|...⟧ Third-party components must not be more than two major versions behind the latest release, and the service register must show the version of each.
- ⟦S:NTF-01|...⟧ Messages sent to customers must not contain card numbers, passwords or images of identity documents.
- ⟦S:EXP-01|...⟧ Exported files that contain personal data must be encrypted and must be deleted from the download location after 7 days.
- ⟦S:EXP-02|...⟧ Exports of more than 1,000 customer records need the written approval of the data owner.
- ⟦S:INV-01|...⟧ Every service must have a named owner and a named deputy in the service register.
- ⟦S:INV-02|...⟧ The service register must list for each service the personal data that it processes and every third party that receives data from it.
- ⟦S:MON-01|...⟧ Alerts of severity high must be acknowledged within 15 minutes.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 600 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c621_reporting_export/design_marked.md
