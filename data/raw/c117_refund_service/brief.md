# Writer brief: c117_refund_service

Author profile `buzzword_pm`: Business framing, security stated as adjectives ("enterprise-grade", "secure by design") with no mechanisms.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=none, terminology=wrong_terms, staleness=none
- typical gaps: every concrete control, algorithms, token lifetimes, network boundaries
- length 900-1600 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 1; TBD markers 0

Service: Lets merchants and support agents request, approve and track refunds of card payments. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: card_data, pii)

Components:
- Refunds Gateway (api_gateway)
- refund-core (service)
- refund-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- refund-events (Kafka) (message_queue)

Flows:
- Merchant backend and support agents -> Refunds Gateway: refund requests and approvals
- Refunds Gateway -> refund-core: authenticated refund requests
- refund-core -> refund-db (PostgreSQL): refund records with payment references
- refund-core -> refund-events (Kafka): refund status events

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/refunds: Request a refund
- GET /v1/refunds/{refundId}: Retrieve a refund
- GET /v1/refunds: List refunds
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/approval: Approve or reject a refund
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/cancellation: Cancel a pending refund

## Planted items
- F1 [ambiguity, high] Mention Refunds Gateway naturally, but do NOT state: How the service checks that the caller may access the requested record. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention Refunds Gateway (the place where that information should have been) in the F1 marker.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Every employee with access gets the admin role to avoid permission tickets.
- F3 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Unlimited login attempts are allowed for convenience.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:AUTH-01|...⟧ Every externally reachable API endpoint must authenticate callers with OAuth2/OIDC bearer tokens or mutual TLS.
- ⟦S:AUTH-03|...⟧ Access tokens must expire within 15 minutes and refresh tokens must be rotated on use.
- ⟦S:LOG-02|...⟧ Logs must not contain secrets, card numbers, or personal data beyond opaque identifiers.
- ⟦S:AUTH-02|...⟧ Internal service calls must be authenticated with mutual TLS or signed workload identity tokens.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-04|...⟧ Administrative and debug endpoints must not be reachable from the public internet.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-02|...⟧ Primary account numbers must never be stored in clear text and must be tokenized by the card token vault.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-06|...⟧ Encryption keys must be held in KMS, never stored with the data they protect, and rotated at least annually.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-07|...⟧ Services must validate TLS certificates and must not disable verification.
- ⟦S:DATA-02|...⟧ Personal data must have a defined retention period and be deleted when it expires or on verified request.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|...⟧ Secrets must not appear in source code, configuration files, specifications or infrastructure definitions.
- ⟦S:SECRET-02|...⟧ Runtime secrets must be fetched from the approved secret store at startup.
- ⟦S:NET-05|...⟧ External APIs must sit behind a WAF with rate limiting.
- ⟦S:NET-01|...⟧ Databases and message brokers must not be publicly reachable and must live in private subnets.
- ⟦S:NET-04|...⟧ Services calling third parties must have egress restricted to an approved allowlist.
- ⟦S:LOG-01|...⟧ Authentication failures, privilege changes and access to sensitive data must be logged.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:DATA-04|...⟧ Non-production environments must not contain real personal or card data.
- ⟦S:LOG-04|...⟧ Access to centralized logs must be limited to authorized staff.
- ⟦S:API-01|...⟧ All external inputs must be validated against a schema and rejected if invalid.
- ⟦S:API-03|...⟧ Outbound and inbound webhook payloads must be signed and signatures verified.
- ⟦S:API-04|...⟧ Error responses must not reveal stack traces, SQL or internal hostnames.
- ⟦S:API-05|...⟧ Database queries must be parameterized; string concatenation of user input into queries is prohibited.
- ⟦S:OPS-01|...⟧ CI must scan dependencies and images and critical vulnerabilities must be fixed within 14 days.
- ⟦S:OPS-02|...⟧ Containers must run as a non-root user with a read-only root filesystem where possible.
- ⟦S:API-02|...⟧ External APIs must enforce per-client rate limits.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-04|...⟧ Traffic between services and to data stores must be encrypted in transit.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 900 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/refunds: request fields payment_id, amount, currency, reason, requested_by; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- GET /v1/refunds/{refundId}: request fields none; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- GET /v1/refunds: request fields none; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/approval: request fields decision, comment; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/cancellation: request fields reason; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c117_refund_service/design_marked.md
