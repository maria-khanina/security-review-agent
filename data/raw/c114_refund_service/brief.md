# Writer brief: c114_refund_service

Author profile `junior_tutorial`: Explains basics at length and mixes up concepts such as hashing, encryption and encoding, or JWT and sessions.

Service: Lets merchants and support agents request, approve and track refunds of card payments. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: card_data, pii)

Components:
- Refunds Gateway (api_gateway)
- refund-core (service)
- refund-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- refund-events (Kafka) (message_queue)

Flows:
- Merchant backend and support agents -> Refunds Gateway: refund requests and approvals
- Refunds Gateway -> refund-core: authenticated refund requests
- refund-core -> refund-db (PostgreSQL): refund records with payment references
- refund-core -> refund-events (Kafka): refund status events

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/refunds: Request a refund
- GET /v1/refunds/{refundId}: Retrieve a refund
- GET /v1/refunds: List refunds
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/approval: Approve or reject a refund
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/cancellation: Cancel a pending refund

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Token lifetime is configurable per client and most merchants use thirty days.
- F2 [ambiguity, high] Mention Refunds Gateway naturally, but do NOT state: How the service checks that the caller may access the requested record. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention Refunds Gateway (the place where that information should have been) in the F2 marker.
- F3 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Error responses include stack traces and SQL text in all environments.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:AUTH-01|...⟧ Every externally reachable API endpoint must authenticate callers with OAuth2/OIDC bearer tokens or mutual TLS.
- ⟦S:AUTH-06|...⟧ Login and token endpoints must throttle or lock out repeated failed attempts.

- ⟦S:DATA-04|...⟧ Non-production environments must not contain real personal or card data.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:DATA-05|...⟧ Reports and exports containing personal data must require authorization, be encrypted in storage and expire.
- ⟦S:API-01|...⟧ All external inputs must be validated against a schema and rejected if invalid.
- ⟦S:API-03|...⟧ Outbound and inbound webhook payloads must be signed and signatures verified.
- ⟦S:API-05|...⟧ Database queries must be parameterized; string concatenation of user input into queries is prohibited.

- ⟦S:OPS-02|...⟧ Containers must run as a non-root user with a read-only root filesystem where possible.
- ⟦S:OPS-03|...⟧ Backups must be encrypted and restoration must be tested at least twice a year.
- ⟦S:SECRET-03|...⟧ Service credentials must be rotated at least every 90 days and immediately after suspected exposure.
- ⟦S:DATA-01|...⟧ Services must collect and store only the personal data needed for their purpose.
- ⟦S:LOG-03|...⟧ Audit logs must be tamper-evident and retained for at least one year.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-03|...⟧ All external traffic must use TLS 1.2 or higher.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1500 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/refunds: request fields payment_id, amount, currency, reason, requested_by; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- GET /v1/refunds/{refundId}: request fields none; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- GET /v1/refunds: request fields none; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/approval: request fields decision, comment; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency
- POST /v1/refunds/{refundId}/cancellation: request fields reason; response fields id, payment_id, status, amount, currency

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c114_refund_service/design_marked.md
