# Writer brief: c725_wallet_service

Author profile `buzzword_pm`: Business framing, security stated as adjectives ("enterprise-grade", "secure by design") with no mechanisms.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=none, terminology=wrong_terms, staleness=none
- typical gaps: every concrete control, algorithms, token lifetimes, network boundaries
- length 900-1600 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage light; dangling references 1; TBD markers 0

Service: Consumer wallet balances, top-ups and peer-to-peer transfers. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii, credentials)

Components:
- Mobile API Gateway (api_gateway)
- wallet-core (service)
- wallet-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Keycloak (identity_provider)

Flows:
- Mobile app -> Mobile API Gateway: wallet and transfer requests
- Mobile API Gateway -> Keycloak: token validation
- Mobile API Gateway -> wallet-core: authenticated requests
- wallet-core -> wallet-db (PostgreSQL): balances and transactions

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}: Retrieve wallet and balance
- POST /v1/wallets/{walletId}/topups: Top up a wallet from a funding source
- POST /v1/transfers: Transfer money between wallets
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}/transactions: List wallet transactions
- PATCH /v1/wallets/{walletId}/profile: Update wallet owner profile

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): A change of the error format is not considered breaking.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Customers have no daily limit, the fraud team looks at large transfers afterwards.
- F3 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Old versions are kept as long as somebody complains.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:REC-01|...⟧ Balances must be reconciled with the ledger every day, and a difference of more than 0.01 EUR must be reported to the finance team within 24 hours.
- ⟦S:IDM-01|...⟧ Operations that move money must be idempotent: a repeated request with the same key must not move the money again.
- ⟦S:SBX-01|...⟧ The sandbox for merchants must contain no real customer data and must run separately from production.
- ⟦S:MSG-02|...⟧ Messages in queues must be deleted after they are processed.
- ⟦S:SUP-01|...⟧ Support agents must see card numbers and document numbers only in masked form.
- ⟦S:SUP-02|...⟧ Changes to the phone number or the email address of a customer need a one-time code that is sent to the old contact data.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 900 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}: request fields none; response fields id, owner_name, balance, currency
- POST /v1/wallets/{walletId}/topups: request fields amount, funding_source_id; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- POST /v1/transfers: request fields from_wallet_id, to_wallet_id, amount, note; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}/transactions: request fields none; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- PATCH /v1/wallets/{walletId}/profile: request fields owner_name, phone_number, address; response fields id, owner_name, balance, currency

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c725_wallet_service/design_marked.md
