Author profile `merged_two_authors`: Two people wrote different halves; heading levels, terminology and level of detail change midway and sections disagree.

- typical gaps: consistency between the halves
- length 1500-2600 words; typo rate 0.03; markdown breakage light; dangling references 1; TBD markers 0

Service: Back-office API for merchants to view settlements, manage users and download reports. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- Portal Gateway (api_gateway)
- portal-backend (service)
- portal-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Keycloak (identity_provider)
- Merchant web app (client_app)

Flows:
- Merchant web app -> Portal Gateway: settlement queries and user management
- Portal Gateway -> Keycloak: token validation
- Portal Gateway -> portal-backend: authenticated requests
- portal-backend -> portal-db (PostgreSQL): settlements and merchant users

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- GET /v1/settlements: List settlements
- GET /v1/settlements/{settlementId}: Get a settlement
- POST /v1/users: Invite a merchant user
- PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/role: Change a merchant user role
- POST /v1/reports: Request a transaction report
- GET /v1/reports/{reportId}/download: Download a finished report

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Old versions are kept as long as somebody complains.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:REC-01|...⟧ Balances must be reconciled with the ledger every day, and a difference of more than 0.01 EUR must be reported to the finance team within 24 hours.
- ⟦S:REC-02|...⟧ Differences found in a reconciliation must be resolved within 5 working days.
- ⟦S:LIM-01|...⟧ The daily outgoing transfers of a customer must be limited to the amount in the limit table, and a change of a limit needs the approval of a second employee.
- ⟦S:VER-02|...⟧ Breaking changes of an API must be released only as a new version of the API.
- ⟦S:SBX-01|...⟧ The sandbox for merchants must contain no real customer data and must run separately from production.
- ⟦S:MSG-01|...⟧ Messages that cannot be processed must be moved to a dead-letter queue and be examined within one working day.
- ⟦S:JOB-01|...⟧ Scheduled jobs must run with their own service account that cannot log in interactively.
- ⟦S:SUP-01|...⟧ Support agents must see card numbers and document numbers only in masked form.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1500 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- GET /v1/settlements: request fields none; response fields id, period, gross, fees, net
- GET /v1/settlements/{settlementId}: request fields none; response fields id, period, gross, fees, net
- POST /v1/users: request fields email, role; response fields id, email, role
- PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/role: request fields role; response fields id, email, role
- POST /v1/reports: request fields report_type, from_date, to_date; response fields id, status, expires_at
- GET /v1/reports/{reportId}/download: request fields none; response fields id, status, expires_at

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c713_merchant_portal_api/design_marked.md
