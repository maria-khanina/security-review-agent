# Writer brief: c717_payment_gateway

Author profile `table_lover`: Everything in tables (components, endpoints, data stores); prose is minimal and some tables are malformed.
- structure=tables_only, english=jargon_dense, hedging=none, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: reasons and conditions that do not fit a table cell
- length 600-1300 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage light; dangling references 0; TBD markers 0

Service: Accepts card payments from merchants, routes to acquirers, publishes payment events. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: card_data, pii)

Components:
- Payments Edge Gateway (api_gateway)
- payments-core (service)
- payments-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Acquirer connector (third_party)
- payment-events (Kafka) (message_queue)

Flows:
- Merchant backend -> Payments Edge Gateway: payment request with card token
- Payments Edge Gateway -> payments-core: validated payment request
- payments-core -> payments-db (PostgreSQL): payment records
- payments-core -> Acquirer connector: authorization request
- payments-core -> payment-events (Kafka): payment status events

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/payments: Create a payment
- GET /v1/payments/{paymentId}: Retrieve a payment
- POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/capture: Capture an authorized payment
- POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/refunds: Refund a payment
- GET /v1/payments: List payments

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Only the payment endpoint is idempotent, transfers are not.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Balances are compared with the ledger once a month when finance closes the books.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:REC-02|...⟧ Differences found in a reconciliation must be resolved within 5 working days.
- ⟦S:LIM-01|...⟧ The daily outgoing transfers of a customer must be limited to the amount in the limit table, and a change of a limit needs the approval of a second employee.
- ⟦S:VER-01|...⟧ A replaced version of an API must be kept for 12 months, and its removal must be announced 90 days in advance.
- ⟦S:MSG-01|...⟧ Messages that cannot be processed must be moved to a dead-letter queue and be examined within one working day.
- ⟦S:MSG-02|...⟧ Messages in queues must be deleted after they are processed.
- ⟦S:JOB-01|...⟧ Scheduled jobs must run with their own service account that cannot log in interactively.
- ⟦S:SUP-02|...⟧ Changes to the phone number or the email address of a customer need a one-time code that is sent to the old contact data.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 600 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/payments: request fields amount, currency, card_token, merchant_id, reference; response fields id, status, amount, currency, last4, merchant_id
- GET /v1/payments/{paymentId}: request fields none; response fields id, status, amount, currency, last4, merchant_id
- POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/capture: request fields amount; response fields id, status, amount, currency, last4, merchant_id
- POST /v1/payments/{paymentId}/refunds: request fields amount, reason; response fields id, status, amount
- GET /v1/payments: request fields none; response fields id, status, amount, currency, last4, merchant_id

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c717_payment_gateway/design_marked.md
