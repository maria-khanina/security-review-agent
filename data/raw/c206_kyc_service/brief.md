# Writer brief: c206_kyc_service

Author profile `copy_paste_veteran`: Built from an older design with find-and-replace; stale service names and sentences that contradict the new section.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=none, terminology=aliases_drift, staleness=heavy_copy_paste
- typical gaps: which version of the auth scheme is current
- length 1400-2400 words; typo rate 0.0; markdown breakage light; dangling references 1; TBD markers 0

Service: Collects identity documents, calls a third-party verification vendor, stores results. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii)

Components:
- kyc-orchestrator (service)
- kyc-documents (S3) (object_storage)
- kyc-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Identity verification vendor (third_party)

Flows:
- Customer app -> kyc-orchestrator: identity details and document images
- kyc-orchestrator -> kyc-documents (S3): document images
- kyc-orchestrator -> kyc-db (PostgreSQL): case records
- kyc-orchestrator -> Identity verification vendor: verification request

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/kyc/cases: Open a verification case
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/documents: Upload an identity document
- GET /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}: Get case status
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/submit: Submit the case to the verification vendor
- GET /v1/kyc/cases: List cases

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Archives are accepted and unpacked without any limit on their size.
- F2 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Scan failures are logged and the file is released anyway.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:MOB-01|...⟧ Mobile apps must pin the public key or the certificate of the Meridian Pay API and must refuse connections that fail the check.
- ⟦S:MOB-02|...⟧ Mobile apps must keep tokens and keys only in the secure storage of the operating system and never in preferences or in files.
- ⟦S:TPC-01|...⟧ Every third-party SDK or library must be approved before its first use, and the list of approved components must be reviewed every six months.
- ⟦S:IR-02|...⟧ Every service must have a written incident runbook, a named on-call owner and a rehearsal at least twice a year.
- ⟦S:DR-02|...⟧ The recovery time objective of a critical service must not exceed 4 hours, and it must be proven by a failover exercise at least once a year.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1400 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/kyc/cases: request fields customer_id, full_name, date_of_birth, country; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/documents: request fields document_type, content_base64; response fields document_id, received_at
- GET /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}: request fields none; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/submit: request fields consent; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- GET /v1/kyc/cases: request fields none; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c206_kyc_service/design_marked.md
