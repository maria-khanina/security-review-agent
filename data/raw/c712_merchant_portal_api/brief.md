# Writer brief: c712_merchant_portal_api

Author profile `compliance_voice`: Legalistic language citing standards and "in accordance with company policy" without saying what is actually done.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=none, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: concrete mechanism behind every claimed compliance
- length 1200-2200 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 0

Service: Back-office API for merchants to view settlements, manage users and download reports. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- Portal Gateway (api_gateway)
- portal-backend (service)
- portal-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Keycloak (identity_provider)
- Merchant web app (client_app)

Flows:
- Merchant web app -> Portal Gateway: settlement queries and user management
- Portal Gateway -> Keycloak: token validation
- Portal Gateway -> portal-backend: authenticated requests
- portal-backend -> portal-db (PostgreSQL): settlements and merchant users

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- GET /v1/settlements: List settlements
- GET /v1/settlements/{settlementId}: Get a settlement
- POST /v1/users: Invite a merchant user
- PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/role: Change a merchant user role
- POST /v1/reports: Request a transaction report
- GET /v1/reports/{reportId}/download: Download a finished report

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Versions are retired without a date and the customers find out when their calls fail.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Balances are compared with the ledger once a month when finance closes the books.
- F3 [ambiguity, medium] Mention portal-backend naturally, but do NOT state: Within what time differences found in a reconciliation are resolved. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention portal-backend (the place where that information should have been) in the F3 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:IDM-01|...⟧ Operations that move money must be idempotent: a repeated request with the same key must not move the money again.
- ⟦S:SBX-01|...⟧ The sandbox for merchants must contain no real customer data and must run separately from production.
- ⟦S:MSG-01|...⟧ Messages that cannot be processed must be moved to a dead-letter queue and be examined within one working day.
- ⟦S:MSG-02|...⟧ Messages in queues must be deleted after they are processed.
- ⟦S:JOB-01|...⟧ Scheduled jobs must run with their own service account that cannot log in interactively.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1200 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- GET /v1/settlements: request fields none; response fields id, period, gross, fees, net
- GET /v1/settlements/{settlementId}: request fields none; response fields id, period, gross, fees, net
- POST /v1/users: request fields email, role; response fields id, email, role
- PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/role: request fields role; response fields id, email, role
- POST /v1/reports: request fields report_type, from_date, to_date; response fields id, status, expires_at
- GET /v1/reports/{reportId}/download: request fields none; response fields id, status, expires_at

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c712_merchant_portal_api/design_marked.md
