# Writer brief: c500_wallet_service

Author profile `methodical_architect`: Thorough and tidy, but works at a high level of abstraction and skips operational details.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: secret rotation, key ownership, who can query the database directly, logging of sensitive fields
- length 1800-2600 words; typo rate 0.0; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 2

Service: Consumer wallet balances, top-ups and peer-to-peer transfers. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii, credentials)

Components:
- Mobile API Gateway (api_gateway)
- wallet-core (service)
- wallet-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Keycloak (identity_provider)

Flows:
- Mobile app -> Mobile API Gateway: wallet and transfer requests
- Mobile API Gateway -> Keycloak: token validation
- Mobile API Gateway -> wallet-core: authenticated requests
- wallet-core -> wallet-db (PostgreSQL): balances and transactions

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}: Retrieve wallet and balance
- POST /v1/wallets/{walletId}/topups: Top up a wallet from a funding source
- POST /v1/transfers: Transfer money between wallets
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}/transactions: List wallet transactions
- PATCH /v1/wallets/{walletId}/profile: Update wallet owner profile

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Deletion requests wait in a mailbox until someone finds the time, often for months.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Credentials are shared between pipelines of different teams.
- F3 [ambiguity, high] Mention wallet-core naturally, but do NOT state: How a feature that moves money can be switched off and whether this is tested. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention wallet-core (the place where that information should have been) in the F3 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:RES-02|...⟧ Backups and replicas of personal data of customers in the EU should stay in regions of the EU as well.
- ⟦S:PIP-02|...⟧ Build artifacts must be signed, and the signature must be verified before deployment.
- ⟦S:CHG-02|...⟧ Every change to production must have a rollback plan that has been tested in a pre-production environment.
- ⟦S:OBS-01|...⟧ Traces and metrics must not contain personal data or card data.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1800 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}: request fields none; response fields id, owner_name, balance, currency
- POST /v1/wallets/{walletId}/topups: request fields amount, funding_source_id; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- POST /v1/transfers: request fields from_wallet_id, to_wallet_id, amount, note; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- GET /v1/wallets/{walletId}/transactions: request fields none; response fields id, type, amount, created_at
- PATCH /v1/wallets/{walletId}/profile: request fields owner_name, phone_number, address; response fields id, owner_name, balance, currency

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c500_wallet_service/design_marked.md
