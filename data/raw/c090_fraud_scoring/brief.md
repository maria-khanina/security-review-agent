# Writer brief: c090_fraud_scoring

Author profile `ticket_writer`: Jira style with user stories, numbered requirements and acceptance criteria; non-functional requirements are afterthoughts.
- structure=ticket_style, english=native_fluent, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: security as acceptance criteria, data classification
- length 900-1700 words; typo rate 0.0; markdown breakage none; dangling references 0; TBD markers 2

Service: Real-time risk scoring consuming payment events and writing decisions. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- scoring-engine (service)
- payment-events (MSK) (message_queue)
- decisions-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- scoring audit log group (log_pipeline)

Flows:
- payment-events (MSK) -> scoring-engine: payment events with customer attributes
- scoring-engine -> decisions-db (PostgreSQL): risk decisions
- scoring-engine -> scoring audit log group: audit records

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `scoring_key`
- msk `payment_events`
- rds `decisions_db` (holds pii)
- sg `decisions_sg`
- loggroup `scoring_audit`
- iam `scoring_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Only HTTP access logs from the load balancer are kept.
- F2 [violation, low] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): There is no periodic review of who has production access.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:AUTH-02|...⟧ Internal service calls must be authenticated with mutual TLS or signed workload identity tokens.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|...⟧ Secrets must not appear in source code, configuration files, specifications or infrastructure definitions.
- ⟦S:NET-01|...⟧ Databases and message brokers must not be publicly reachable and must live in private subnets.
- ⟦S:LOG-04|...⟧ Access to centralized logs must be limited to authorized staff.
- ⟦S:DATA-01|...⟧ Services must collect and store only the personal data needed for their purpose.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:DATA-05|...⟧ Reports and exports containing personal data must require authorization, be encrypted in storage and expire.
- ⟦S:API-05|...⟧ Database queries must be parameterized; string concatenation of user input into queries is prohibited.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-02|...⟧ Internal users must receive only the roles required for their job and roles must be defined per service.
- ⟦S:SECRET-02|...⟧ Runtime secrets must be fetched from the approved secret store at startup.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-04|...⟧ Traffic between services and to data stores must be encrypted in transit.
- ⟦S:DATA-02|...⟧ Personal data must have a defined retention period and be deleted when it expires or on verified request.
- ⟦S:OPS-03|...⟧ Backups must be encrypted and restoration must be tested at least twice a year.
- ⟦S:OPS-01|...⟧ CI must scan dependencies and images and critical vulnerabilities must be fixed within 14 days.
- ⟦S:LOG-02|...⟧ Logs must not contain secrets, card numbers, or personal data beyond opaque identifiers.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 900 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c090_fraud_scoring/design_marked.md
