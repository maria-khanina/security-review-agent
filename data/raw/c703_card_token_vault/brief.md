# Writer brief: c703_card_token_vault

Author profile `methodical_architect`: Thorough and tidy, but works at a high level of abstraction and skips operational details.
- structure=clean_headings, english=native_fluent, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: secret rotation, key ownership, who can query the database directly, logging of sensitive fields
- length 1800-2600 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage none; dangling references 1; TBD markers 0

Service: PCI-scoped store that tokenizes primary account numbers for other services. (Meridian Pay, internal exposure, data: card_data)

Components:
- tokenization-service (service)
- vault-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Vault and KMS (secret_store)
- vault private subnet (network)

Flows:
- Payment services -> tokenization-service: primary account numbers to tokenize and tokens to detokenize
- tokenization-service -> vault-db (PostgreSQL): encrypted card data
- tokenization-service -> Vault and KMS: data encryption key requests

Implementation (terraform) the document describes:
- kms `vault_key`
- rds `vault_db` (holds card_data)
- sg `vault_db_sg`
- loggroup `vault_audit`
- backup_vault `vault_backups`
- iam `vault_service_policy`

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, medium] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Fields are renamed in place and customers are told in the chat.
- F2 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Masking applies to the search page but not to the detail page.
- F3 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Resolution is tracked in the chat and not in a ticket.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:REC-01|...⟧ Balances must be reconciled with the ledger every day, and a difference of more than 0.01 EUR must be reported to the finance team within 24 hours.
- ⟦S:IDM-01|...⟧ Operations that move money must be idempotent: a repeated request with the same key must not move the money again.
- ⟦S:LIM-01|...⟧ The daily outgoing transfers of a customer must be limited to the amount in the limit table, and a change of a limit needs the approval of a second employee.
- ⟦S:VER-01|...⟧ A replaced version of an API must be kept for 12 months, and its removal must be announced 90 days in advance.
- ⟦S:MSG-01|...⟧ Messages that cannot be processed must be moved to a dead-letter queue and be examined within one working day.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1800 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c703_card_token_vault/design_marked.md
