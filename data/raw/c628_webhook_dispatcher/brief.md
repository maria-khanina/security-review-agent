# Writer brief: c628_webhook_dispatcher

Author profile `merged_two_authors`: Two people wrote different halves; heading levels, terminology and level of detail change midway and sections disagree.
- structure=merged_voices, english=native_sloppy, hedging=low, terminology=aliases_drift, staleness=some_outdated
- typical gaps: consistency between the halves
- length 1500-2600 words; typo rate 0.03; markdown breakage heavy; dangling references 1; TBD markers 0

Service: Delivers signed event callbacks to merchant endpoints with retries. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: internal)

Components:
- dispatcher (service)
- delivery-queue (message_queue)
- Merchant callback endpoints (third_party)

Flows:
- Platform services -> dispatcher: events to deliver
- dispatcher -> delivery-queue: pending deliveries
- dispatcher -> Merchant callback endpoints: signed event payloads

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/subscriptions: Register a callback endpoint
- GET /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Retrieve a subscription
- POST /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/rotate-secret: Rotate the signing secret
- GET /v1/deliveries: List delivery attempts
- POST /v1/deliveries/{deliveryId}/replay: Replay a delivery

## Planted items
None. This is a clean case: no violation and no ambiguity.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:ARC-02|...⟧ Documents uploaded by customers must be deleted within 30 days after the account is closed.
- ⟦S:VUL-01|...⟧ Vulnerabilities rated critical must be fixed in production within 7 days after they are published.
- ⟦S:TST-01|...⟧ Production data must not be copied to test or development environments.
- ⟦S:TST-02|...⟧ Test accounts in production must be removed within 7 days after the test ends.
- ⟦S:NTF-01|...⟧ Messages sent to customers must not contain card numbers, passwords or images of identity documents.
- ⟦S:INV-01|...⟧ Every service must have a named owner and a named deputy in the service register.
- ⟦S:MON-01|...⟧ Alerts of severity high must be acknowledged within 15 minutes.
- ⟦S:WHK-01|...⟧ Callbacks to endpoints of customers must be signed and must carry a timestamp that the receiver can check against replay.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1500 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/subscriptions: request fields url, event_types, description; response fields id, url, status
- GET /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: request fields none; response fields id, url, status
- POST /v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/rotate-secret: request fields grace_period_hours; response fields id, url, status
- GET /v1/deliveries: request fields none; response fields id, event_type, status, attempts
- POST /v1/deliveries/{deliveryId}/replay: request fields reason; response fields id, event_type, status, attempts

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c628_webhook_dispatcher/design_marked.md
