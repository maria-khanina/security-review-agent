# Writer brief: c081_merchant_portal_api

Author profile `merged_two_authors`: Two people wrote different halves; heading levels, terminology and level of detail change midway and sections disagree.
- structure=merged_voices, english=native_sloppy, hedging=low, terminology=aliases_drift, staleness=some_outdated
- typical gaps: consistency between the halves
- length 1500-2600 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage heavy; dangling references 0; TBD markers 0

Service: Back-office API for merchants to view settlements, manage users and download reports. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii, internal)

Components:
- Portal Gateway (api_gateway)
- portal-backend (service)
- portal-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Keycloak (identity_provider)
- Merchant web app (client_app)

Flows:
- Merchant web app -> Portal Gateway: settlement queries and user management
- Portal Gateway -> Keycloak: token validation
- Portal Gateway -> portal-backend: authenticated requests
- portal-backend -> portal-db (PostgreSQL): settlements and merchant users

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- GET /v1/settlements: List settlements
- GET /v1/settlements/{settlementId}: Get a settlement
- POST /v1/users: Invite a merchant user
- PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/role: Change a merchant user role
- POST /v1/reports: Request a transaction report
- GET /v1/reports/{reportId}/download: Download a finished report

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Dynamic queries are assembled with string formatting because the ORM is too slow.
- F2 [drift, high] State as plain fact, adapted to this service: All traffic is served over HTTPS only. Wrap the sentence(s) in the F2 marker.
- F3 [drift, critical] State as plain fact, adapted to this service: The service exposes only the endpoints listed in the API section. Wrap the sentence(s) in the F3 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:AUTH-01|...⟧ Every externally reachable API endpoint must authenticate callers with OAuth2/OIDC bearer tokens or mutual TLS.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-01|...⟧ Every request for a customer-owned resource must verify that the caller owns or is entitled to that resource.
- ⟦S:AUTHZ-05|...⟧ Access rights to production systems must be reviewed at least quarterly.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-01|...⟧ Personally identifiable information must be encrypted at rest with AES-256 or stronger.
- ⟦S:CRYPTO-05|...⟧ Only approved cryptographic algorithms may be used; MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES and ECB mode are prohibited.
- ⟦S:SECRET-01|...⟧ Secrets must not appear in source code, configuration files, specifications or infrastructure definitions.
- ⟦S:NET-01|...⟧ Databases and message brokers must not be publicly reachable and must live in private subnets.
- ⟦S:LOG-01|...⟧ Authentication failures, privilege changes and access to sensitive data must be logged.
- ⟦S:DATA-01|...⟧ Services must collect and store only the personal data needed for their purpose.
- ⟦S:DATA-03|...⟧ Personal data may be sent to third parties only under an approved data processing agreement and only the fields required.
- ⟦S:API-01|...⟧ All external inputs must be validated against a schema and rejected if invalid.
- ⟦S:DATA-05|...⟧ Reports and exports containing personal data must require authorization, be encrypted in storage and expire.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1500 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- GET /v1/settlements: request fields none; response fields id, period, gross, fees, net
- GET /v1/settlements/{settlementId}: request fields none; response fields id, period, gross, fees, net
- POST /v1/users: request fields email, role; response fields id, email, role
- PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/role: request fields role; response fields id, email, role
- POST /v1/reports: request fields report_type, from_date, to_date; response fields id, status, expires_at
- GET /v1/reports/{reportId}/download: request fields none; response fields id, status, expires_at

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c081_merchant_portal_api/design_marked.md
