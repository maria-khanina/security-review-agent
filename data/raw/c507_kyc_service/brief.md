# Writer brief: c507_kyc_service

Author profile `junior_tutorial`: Explains basics at length and mixes up concepts such as hashing, encryption and encoding, or JWT and sessions.
- structure=clean_headings, english=junior_tutorial, hedging=low, terminology=wrong_terms, staleness=none
- typical gaps: correct choice of primitives
- length 1500-2600 words; typo rate 0.03; markdown breakage light; dangling references 0; TBD markers 2

Service: Collects identity documents, calls a third-party verification vendor, stores results. (Meridian Pay, external exposure, data: pii)

Components:
- kyc-orchestrator (service)
- kyc-documents (S3) (object_storage)
- kyc-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Identity verification vendor (third_party)

Flows:
- Customer app -> kyc-orchestrator: identity details and document images
- kyc-orchestrator -> kyc-documents (S3): document images
- kyc-orchestrator -> kyc-db (PostgreSQL): case records
- kyc-orchestrator -> Identity verification vendor: verification request

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- POST /v1/kyc/cases: Open a verification case
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/documents: Upload an identity document
- GET /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}: Get case status
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/submit: Submit the case to the verification vendor
- GET /v1/kyc/cases: List cases

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Requests from customers outside the home country are not handled.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The region of the storage was never chosen and follows the default of the cloud account.
- F3 [ambiguity, low] Mention kyc-orchestrator naturally, but do NOT state: How the service reports its health and error rate. Wrap the sentence(s) that mention kyc-orchestrator (the place where that information should have been) in the F3 marker.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:PIP-02|...⟧ Build artifacts must be signed, and the signature must be verified before deployment.
- ⟦S:CAP-01|...⟧ Public endpoints must shed load with HTTP 503 instead of queueing requests when their capacity is exhausted.
- ⟦S:PRV-03|...⟧ Personal data must be used only for purposes listed in the privacy notice shown to customers at sign-up.
- ⟦S:CHG-01|...⟧ Every change to production must be reviewed by a second engineer before it is deployed.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1500 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- POST /v1/kyc/cases: request fields customer_id, full_name, date_of_birth, country; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/documents: request fields document_type, content_base64; response fields document_id, received_at
- GET /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}: request fields none; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- POST /v1/kyc/cases/{caseId}/submit: request fields consent; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id
- GET /v1/kyc/cases: request fields none; response fields id, status, risk_level, customer_id

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c507_kyc_service/design_marked.md
