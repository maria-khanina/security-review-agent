# Writer brief: c623_support_console_api

Author profile `esl_engineer`: Competent engineer writing in a second language; missing articles, literal translations of idioms, odd word order.
- structure=clean_headings, english=esl_calques, hedging=low, terminology=consistent, staleness=none
- typical gaps: negations and obligations phrased ambiguously, e.g. "should not be only encrypted"
- length 1000-1800 words; typo rate 0.01; markdown breakage light; dangling references 0; TBD markers 0

Service: Back-office API for support agents to look up customers, reset second factors and issue goodwill credits. (Meridian Pay, admin exposure, data: pii, credentials)

Components:
- console-backend (service)
- console-db (PostgreSQL) (database)
- Keycloak (identity_provider)
- Support web console (client_app)

Flows:
- Support web console -> console-backend: customer lookups and account actions
- console-backend -> Keycloak: agent token validation
- console-backend -> console-db (PostgreSQL): customer profiles and agent action records

Implementation (openapi) the document describes:
- GET /v1/customers: Search customers
- GET /v1/customers/{customerId}: Retrieve a customer profile
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/second-factor-reset: Reset the second factor of a customer
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/credits: Issue a goodwill credit
- GET /v1/agent-actions: List actions taken by support agents
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/data-export: Export the data held about a customer

## Planted items
- F1 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): Exports of up to 100,000 records are not approved because the data is pseudonymised.
- F2 [violation, critical] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): A sample of 1,000 real customers is used for acceptance tests.
- F3 [violation, high] State, as the author naturally would and believing it acceptable, a design decision of this kind (use your own words and this service's context; do not copy the wording): The download link of an export never expires.

## Required compliance statements
State each of these concretely (terse is fine for terse profiles) and wrap the statement in the marker shown.
- ⟦S:ARC-02|...⟧ Documents uploaded by customers must be deleted within 30 days after the account is closed.
- ⟦S:VUL-01|...⟧ Vulnerabilities rated critical must be fixed in production within 7 days after they are published.
- ⟦S:VUL-02|...⟧ Third-party components must not be more than two major versions behind the latest release, and the service register must show the version of each.
- ⟦S:TST-02|...⟧ Test accounts in production must be removed within 7 days after the test ends.
- ⟦S:MON-01|...⟧ Alerts of severity high must be acknowledged within 15 minutes.

## Functional content (no security claims)
Aim for at least 1000 words in total. Reach the length with functional detail written in the author's voice, never with extra security statements.
Suggested sections: Background and goals, Non-goals, Behavior of each endpoint or resource, Data model, Failure modes and retries, Rollout plan, Open questions.
Do not mention authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets, network exposure, logging, retention, third-party data sharing, input validation, rate limits, dependency scanning, containers or backups except through the planted items and required statements above.
Functional detail to describe for each endpoint:
- GET /v1/customers: request fields none; response fields id, full_name, email, phone_number, status
- GET /v1/customers/{customerId}: request fields none; response fields id, full_name, email, phone_number, status
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/second-factor-reset: request fields reason, ticket_id; response fields id, status
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/credits: request fields amount, currency, reason, ticket_id; response fields id, amount, currency, status
- GET /v1/agent-actions: request fields none; response fields id, agent_id, action, created_at
- POST /v1/customers/{customerId}/data-export: request fields format, reason; response fields id, status, expires_at

## Rules for writing
- Marker syntax: ⟦ID|exact text⟧ with the text unchanged inside; markers must not nest.
- Introduce no other policy violation, ambiguity about a required statement, or contradiction beyond the planted items.
- Typos, sloppy structure, TBDs and stale mentions are welcome but must not hide or alter the planted items or required statements.
- Save to data/raw/c623_support_console_api/design_marked.md
